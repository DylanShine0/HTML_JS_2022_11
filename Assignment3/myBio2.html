        <p>Hello my name is Dylan Shine, otherwise my nickname known as Dijon. My computer background expirence like everyone else was when I was a child. I have three years of expirence with computer science but was not enjoyable of an field. I have my own personal coding project that I use to practice game concepts and elements. Like ground hit detetion, gravity, teleportation, hit dection, player body collision, climbing objects, and coin collection, etc. Games I like to play are, Gta V, CS-GO, Rust, Minecraft, Rainbow Six Seige I played competively in high school. I have past prior knownledge of said coding languages like python, javascript, html, css and C#. I also had interests in robotics for a time and also in prostetics but didnt go well with my interests further in time then. I have been in JROTC for 3 years and the overall program is okay in my opinion. I was never serious in the program all I remember know is how to look good in a suit and march around.</p>
